# Healthcare-Azure-Project
End-to-End Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management on Azure

This repository showcases a comprehensive, cloud-native solution for healthcare revenue cycle management. Built on Microsoft Azure, it streamlines key processes—from patient registration and insurance eligibility checks, through coding, billing, and claims submission—all the way to payment reconciliation and financial analytics. By leveraging Azure’s robust data, integration, and security capabilities, this project demonstrates a scalable, cost-effective approach to improving operational efficiency, compliance, and financial outcomes within the healthcare industry.

Details: 
RCM is a process that hospitals use to manage the financial aspects, from the time the patients schedules an appointment till the time the provider gets paid.

**Process Breakdown:**

1. **Patient Registration:** Collect patient and insurance details to determine payment responsibility (e.g., $20,000 total: $15,000 insurance + $5,000 patient).

2. **Service Delivery:** The patient receives medical services and procedures.

3. **Billing:** The hospital generates an itemized bill for the services provided.

4. **Claims Review:** The insurance company reviews the claim and may pay in full, pay partially, or deny the claim.

5. **Payments & Follow-Ups:** Any remaining balance after insurance is settled by the patient. Providers follow up on unpaid amounts to ensure timely reimbursement.

6. **Monitoring & Improvement:** Ongoing tracking of financial and operational metrics helps improve efficiency, reduce denials, and maintain the hospital’s financial health.

**Objective:** This project not only enhances operational efficiency and compliance but also empowers healthcare organizations to measure and improve critical performance indicators. Key metrics include:

- **Days in Accounts Receivable (A/R):** Track how quickly payments are collected, reducing cash flow delays.  
- **Net & Gross Collection Rates:** Assess the effectiveness of billing and collection efforts to ensure optimal revenue capture.  
- **Denial & Rework Rates:** Minimize claim denials and the administrative burden of reprocessing claims.  
- **A/R Aging:** Monitor the percentage of receivables aged over 90 days to proactively address long-standing payment issues.  
- **Clean Claim Rate:** Increase first-pass claim acceptance to reduce administrative costs and improve the revenue cycle’s efficiency.

By focusing on these KPIs, the solution enables data-driven decision-making that leads to more predictable financial outcomes, improved patient satisfaction, and greater resilience in today’s complex healthcare environment.
